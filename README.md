# SPWikiToDocx
Convert a sharepoint wiki library into a DOCX file.
The tool reads each Wiki page in a given SP library and combines all of the contents of the Wiki pages into a single HTML chunk. html-docx-js is used to convert that one large HTML chunk into a DOCX file.
The tool attempts to retrieve each of the images referenced by the Wiki pages and embeds the images as base64 data in the HTML files ("data:image/png;base64,XXXXX") so that the images are visible in the output.
